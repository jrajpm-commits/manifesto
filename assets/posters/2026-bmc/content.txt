Based on the content you provided, here is a tabulated summary. Since the "files" appear to be images of presentation slides (mostly in Thai with some English headings), the slide numbers are assumed from the file names (e.g., page_5 = Slide 5). The content is often abbreviated, symbolic, or contains placeholders, so some interpretation and filling in of gaps is required.

Note: Some slides (like page_12) are purely graphical/title slides with minimal text. Some lines are repetitive or appear to be template text (e.g., "ฟรี พูชา เหล็ก ปริธน พูชา อะบกร"). "Drama stories" are creative interpretations based on the potential real-world implications of each administrative point.
